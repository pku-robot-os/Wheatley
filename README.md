# Wheatley

Wheatley is a chatting robot that we made as a project in PKU EECS operator system 


###requirement:
Linux 
gcc
python3 
[PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/)

###Install 
```
sudo ./build.sh
make
```
for x86 Architecture please run 'make x86'

### To run
Try `./Wheatley` to talk with our robot.
If you have some external_services and you want to add in the robot to make it more cleaver, try `./services_management` to install it. 

### To do list 
* services_management 中add命令中的减号会与正则表达式中的减号冲突，这个问题需要改一下。
